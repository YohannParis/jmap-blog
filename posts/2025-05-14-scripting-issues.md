title: Scripting issues

In the glow of screens, at half past ten,  
I wired up GitHub once again.  
A cron job pings, a script replies,  
To turn my inbox into rhymes.

No pen, no scroll, no poet’s room—  
Just emails birthing blog post bloom.  
A label here, a comment there,  
My verses launch into the air.

Oh joy! Oh build! This sweet deploy,  
A pipeline built not to destroy,  
But to let stanzas flow and fly—  
CI for dreams, not just for dry.

So laugh I did, with tea in hand,  
At Jenkins’ grave, I made my stand.  
For what’s more fun than code and prose,  
And poems sent where no one knows?
